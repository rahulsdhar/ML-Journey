    "Lets spice things up a bit and look for a more complicated situation. Lets take an example where the speed of car is a function of time and remaining distance between the car and the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this situation, there is a bit of ambiguity in the relation between the speed of car and oher parameters like time and remaining distance. To cover up the ambiguity we have to assume another parameter which controls the amount of factor which each parameter contributes indivisually to the key parameter ie the speed of the car. Those parameters are called weights. They are multiplied with their resective parameter and added together to get a final prediction about the key parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have formed the equaton to predict the speed of car as:\n",
    "    S = T*W1 + U*W2\n",
    "    -where,\n",
    "        S=speed of car\n",

    "Now, it is also likely that there could be some off-value regulating the speed along with Time and remaining distance. To counter that likelyhood we can assume another parameter called bias which we will add with the output.\n",

    "### Training The Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important part of training a model is to figure out a way to rate the performance or accuracy of the model. This can be done either by using a loss function or reward based scoring system or fitness based scoring system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loss Function\n",
    "Selecting a Proper Loss Function is crusial to perform a proper training. The loss function is a measure of how off-the-mark the current model can predict. Based on it the weights and biases are adjusted to get the lowest possible value from the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Back Propagation\n",
    "In a way, the loss function maps the weights and biases with the output and thus makes them trackable. By Trackable it means that the ratio of change in weight with respect to the change in output can be calculated. This Ratio is called gradient and this tracking back of gradients using loss function is called back propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimization\n",
    "By now, it is clear that the gradient contains the information related to how the change of a parameter will affect the output and loss function.\n",
    "The next step is applying the gradients in some way to update the model parameters to actually lower the loss function. This process of applying it is called Optimization.\n"

    "### Concept of big data\n",
    "Although the process of training the model seems quite fair but with big data comes big responsibility.\n",
    "Big data is nothing but a large amount of data and as the word big is not well-defined so big data is also not well-defined\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Batching\n",
    "Though the optimization process has been mentioned above very fairly but it would be an understatement to say that it would go without concerning for big data. It should be considered that optimization is not for a single data point only but has to be considered for every data points in the dataset. The loss function is responsible for accounting all the data points in the dataset. It ensures that the updated values is in good terms for all the data points.\n",
    "This means the loss function has to be calculated using a bundle of data. This can cause a probable issue for big data as calculating the loss function for such a massive amount of data would eat up a massive amount of memory and the software could crash due to that; and even if it doesn't crash, it would cause performance issue as calculating it will require a considerable amount of time and processing power.\n",
    "This troublesome situation mentioned earlier can be averted easily by segmenting the big data into smaller data chunks called batches. This process of breaking it down is called batching.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning rate\n",
    "In a situation where there are multiple tunable parameters to provide optimum solution, there is a always a chance for having a multiple optimum configuration. This may interfere the optimization process as the updated parameters could dangle between those points as there is a chance that the model parameter values are being updated independently from other parameters. As a result of this race condition certain instability would occur.\n",
    "For Example, say we have an equation: x+y=5 with initial values as x=3 and y=3. Now the goal of the optimizer here would be to make the output of the equation to be equal to 5. So either x=2 and y=3 or x=3 and y=2 could optimize the problem.\n",
    "As they are being updated indivisually so the optimizer would attempt to update the value of x as x=2 as it wont consider a change in value of y while tracing the gradient. Same goes for y. so finally they both update their values as x=2 and y=2. The optimizer would iterate again and will change the value back to x=3 considering y=2 but again y will update itself as y=3 considering x=2. In short they are not aware of their possible updates and thus ends up dangling between x=3,y=3 and x=2,y=2 and thus never gets optimized properly.\n",
    "To solve this instability of rapidly changing parameters, the update speed is regulated by using a factor called Learning Rate.\n",
    "It means that, if the learning rate is 0.1 and the optimizer want to update the value of x from x=3 to x=2 the optimizer will calculate the change as dx=-1 and then will take a portion of the update by multiplying it with Learning Rate, then adding that portion to the parameter as an update.\n",
    "so, new value of x= previous value of x + (dx * learning rate)\n",
    "therefor if the optimizer want to update the value of x from x=3 to x=2 with learning rate of 0.1 the optimizer will update it to x = 3+(-1*0.1) = 2.9 and y=2.9. Now the next update of x will be aware that the value of y is not 3 but 2.9 and thus required x=2.1 so new x=2.9+(-0.8*0.1) = 2.82 and simillarly y= 2.89 and gradually after several iterations later they will come close to x=2.5 and y=2.5 and this concludes the concept of learning rate.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Epoch\n",
    "Running through the database once might not completely optimize the network at satisfactory level as training the model is a gradual process and requires a lot of time. The repeated running through the same database again and again is backed by the term of epoch. An epoch gives the measure of times the optimizer runs through the same database."
